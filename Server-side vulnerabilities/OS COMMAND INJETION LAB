### Solving the OS Command Injection Lab: (THIS LAB IS EXPLAINED FOR SIMPLIFING UNDERSTANDING) --By:-Glaron Pinto

**Objective:**
- The goal is to exploit an OS command injection vulnerability in a product stock checker to determine the current user running the application by executing the `whoami` command.

**Tools Needed:**
- Burp Suite (a web vulnerability scanner and proxy tool).

**Steps to Solve the Lab:**

1. **Intercept the Request with Burp Suite:**
   - Open Burp Suite and set it up as a proxy for your web browser.
   - Navigate to the stock checker feature in the vulnerable web application.
   - Look for a request that checks the stock level, typically something like:


```
     https://insecure-website.com/stockStatus?productID=381&storeID=29
```


2. **Capture the Request:**
   - Use Burp Suite's "Proxy" tab to intercept the request made by the browser when you check the stock.
   - Ensure interception is on, then perform a stock check on the website. Burp Suite should capture the request.


3. **Modify the Request:**
   - In Burp Suite, find the `storeID` parameter in the intercepted request.
   - Change the value of the `storeID` parameter to include the `whoami` command using a command injection technique:
     
```
     storeID=1|whoami
```
   - The modified request should look something like this:
    
```
     GET /stockStatus?productID=381&storeID=1|whoami HTTP/1.1
     Host: insecure-website.com
```

4. **Forward the Modified Request:**
   - Forward the modified request in Burp Suite.
   - Burp Suite sends the request to the server with the injected command.

5. **Analyze the Response:**
   - Check the server's response in Burp Suite.
   - Look for the output of the `whoami` command within the response body.
   - The response should contain the name of the current user running the application, confirming the command execution.

**Detailed Breakdown of the Command Injection:**

- **Original Parameter:**

```
  storeID=29
```

- **Injected Parameter:**

```
  storeID=1|whoami
```

- **How it Works:**
  - The `|` character is a shell command separator that tells the server to execute the command on the right (`whoami`) after the command on the left (`1`).
  - The application runs the following shell command:
```
  stockreport.pl 381 1|whoami
```
  - This effectively runs:

```
    stockreport.pl 381 1
    whoami
```
  - The `whoami` command outputs the current user's name, which gets included in the server's response.

**Summary:**
- You used Burp Suite to intercept a request.
- You modified the `storeID` parameter to inject the `whoami` command.
- You forwarded the modified request and observed the response to find the current user.
