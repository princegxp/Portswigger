### Horizontal Privilege Escalation: Simplified Explanation --By:- Glaron Pinto

**What is Horizontal Privilege Escalation?**
- Horizontal privilege escalation occurs when a user accesses resources or data belonging to another user instead of their own.
- Example: An employee accessing the records of other employees.

**How Does It Happen?**
- Similar to vertical privilege escalation but targets resources at the same privilege level.
- Example URL:

  ```
  https://insecure-website.com/myaccount?id=123
  ```

  - Here, `id=123` identifies the user's account.
  - An attacker changes `id=123` to another user's ID, like `id=456`, to access that user's account.

**Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):**
- This is an example of IDOR, where user-controlled parameters are used to access resources directly.
- If parameters like user IDs are not properly secured, attackers can manipulate them to access unauthorized data.

**Preventing Horizontal Privilege Escalation:**
- Use unpredictable identifiers, such as GUIDs, instead of sequential numbers.
- Validate user permissions on the server side to ensure they are accessing only their own data.

**Example of GUIDs:**
- GUIDs are complex and not easily guessable.
- Example:
  
```
  https://insecure-website.com/myaccount?id=5d8e5f2a-3f6b-4f98-b9a1-6b8e5e8d8b8a
```

- Even with GUIDs, if they are exposed elsewhere in the application (like in user messages or reviews), they can still be targeted.

**Horizontal to Vertical Privilege Escalation:**
- Sometimes, horizontal privilege escalation can lead to vertical privilege escalation.
- If an attacker accesses another user's account, especially an admin's, they might gain higher-level access.

**Example Scenario:**
1. **Horizontal Escalation:**
   - Attacker changes URL to access another user's account:

```
  https://insecure-website.com/myaccount?id=456
```

2. **Vertical Escalation:**
   - If the target user is an admin, the attacker gains access to the admin page.
   - The admin page might allow changing the admin's password or provide access to admin functions.

**Key Points:**
- Horizontal privilege escalation lets attackers access other users' data at the same privilege level.
- Properly secure and validate user-controlled parameters.
- Use complex, non-predictable identifiers.
- Ensure robust permission checks on the server side.
